# APCS
This repository contains code from my high school APCS class.

### Flag
Contains code to create an American-style flag with a variable number of stars (with a variable number of points), a variable number of stripes, and an ajustable window size. Runs in java using swing package.

### Hivolts
Group project Hivolts game. Player tries to avoid enemy non-player-characters while steering the into electric fences. I coded most of the logic for player movement and enemy movement. Game includes sprites and music, but Java image file search has a tendency to only work on some computers. I suspect there is an incompatability of some versions of Java with some versions of OSX.

### Particle simulator
Create particles that collide into each other and the walls. Animated using swing. Note: all collisions are completely elastic and momentum is not preserved.
